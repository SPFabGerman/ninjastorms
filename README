This is ev3ninja "NinjaStorms"
==============================

NinjaStorms is an attempt to create a simple RealTime Operating System
for the Mindstorms EV3 Platform.

Current Project status:

  ev3ninja should boot correctly and write a welcome message to the serial
  console. After pressing the center button once, a simple light show
  facilitating the internal LEDs should start. After another press the
  external motor is reacting to the external button press (both connected
  via the IO-Ports). Light show and motor control are running concurrently
  using our own preemptive scheduler.

Getting Started:

  Building ev3ninja requires an arm-none-eabi- prefixed toolchain. This
  toolchain can either be acquired from your distributions package manager, or
  built using the build_toolchain.sh script provided in this repository.

  Option A: Using the EV3 connect via serial

    Compile the System by calling
     $> make

    Deploy via serial
     $> ./deploy.sh
     Press C-a, C-s to choose a file to upload.
     $> ev3ninja.bin

    Run the uploaded binary from U-Boot shell.
    (For the load address, scroll up a bit to see the output of deploy.sh)
     $> go 0xc1000XXX

  Option B: Emulating the EV3 with QEMU (for debugging purposes)

    See qemu/readme.txt
